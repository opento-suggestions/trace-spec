# Anchoring a Trust Record to the TRACE registry

After signing a Trust Record, you can anchor it to the TRACE transparency registry. An inclusion proof binds the signed record to a batch root. Any claim about when it existed also depends on authenticating and trusting the registry's checkpoint and timestamp.

**What you need:** A signed Trust Record (from [Signing your first trust record](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/docs/tutorials/signing-your-first-trust-record/index.md)).

**What you'll do:** Submit the record, get back an inclusion proof, and check that proof yourself against the published registry entry.

It previously described POSTing records to a SCITT HTTP API at a registry endpoint. That endpoint does not exist, and the hostname it named was on a domain this project has never controlled, the same defect that forced the [v0.2 profile URI cutover](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/spec/trace-v0.2/index.md). Anchoring works as described below. If you built against the old page, nothing you sent was received by us.

______________________________________________________________________

## Why transparency anchoring matters

A Trust Record carries a signature from the issuer's key. A verifier holding that key can confirm the record has not been modified, but only if the key is trustworthy. If the issuer is later compromised, an attacker holding the key could forge records backdated to before the compromise.

Anchoring introduces a separate trust input: the registry entry or checkpoint. A verifier recomputes the Merkle root from the record and proof and compares it to an independently authenticated entry. Accepting a record, proof, and root from the same untrusted sender establishes only internal consistency. Check the registry's append-only history and timestamp policy separately.

The normative format is [TRACE Registry Anchor Format v1](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/spec/registry-anchor-v1/index.md). Read §0 of it before you implement anything: TRACE uses **RFC 8785 (JCS)** to canonicalize a record for *signing* and **sorted-key JSON** to canonicalize it for the *anchor leaf*. Assuming JCS at the leaf produces proofs that never verify, and the failure has no useful diagnostic.

______________________________________________________________________

## The `transparency` field

In the `TrustRecord` schema, `transparency` is optional below Level 2:

```
transparency: str | None
```

`None` means the record is unanchored, which is the honest state for a Level 0 or Level 1 record. An empty string is rejected: `""` is not a URI, and a field that looks populated but resolves to nothing is worse in a trust record than an absent one.

Where present, it identifies the registry entry anchoring the record. At Level 2 and above, a verifier must be able to retrieve that entry and check inclusion without contacting you.

______________________________________________________________________

## Step 1: Sign the record

Sign the final record. Leave `transparency` absent if the registry entry URI is not known yet; distribute the receipt separately. If the registry supports reserving an entry URI, set that URI before signing and submit those exact signed bytes. Do not invent a placeholder URI.

```
import time
from agentrust_trace.sign import generate_key, sign_record

key = generate_key()

record = {
    "eat_profile": "tag:agentrust-io.com,2026:trace-v0.2",
    "iat": int(time.time()),
    "subject": "spiffe://example.org/agent/my-agent",
    "model": {"provider": "example-provider", "model_id": "example-model-1"},
    "runtime": {"platform": "software-only", "measurement": "sha256:" + "0" * 64},
    "policy": {"bundle_hash": "sha256:" + "a" * 64, "enforcement_mode": "enforce"},
    "data_class": "internal",
    "build_provenance": {"slsa_level": 0, "digest": "sha256:" + "b" * 64},
    "appraisal": {"status": "none", "verifier": "self"},
}

signed = sign_record(record, key)
```

The anchored unit is the signed object

Anchoring binds the complete signed claim, signature included. Change either the body or the signature after anchoring and the proof stops verifying, which is the property you want.

______________________________________________________________________

## Step 2: Submit the record

Producers submit signed records to the registry's staging area, one JSON file per record. The anchor pipeline runs on a schedule, groups pending records by producer, builds one Merkle batch per group, and writes both the registry entry and one inclusion proof per record.

You do not have to use the reference registry. Anything implementing [Anchor Format v1 §8](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/spec/registry-anchor-v1/index.md) works, and running your own is a reasonable choice for a deployment that cannot publish record bytes to a third party.

______________________________________________________________________

## Step 3: Retrieve your inclusion proof

The pipeline writes one proof per submitted record:

```
{"leaf_index": 0, "audit_path": ["sha256:...", "sha256:..."]}
```

`leaf_index` is your record's position in the batch. `audit_path` is the sibling hash at each tree level, ordered leaf to root. A batch of one has an empty `audit_path`, which is valid and not an error.

______________________________________________________________________

## Step 4: Verify the proof yourself

This is the step that matters, and the one most likely to be skipped. A proof you have never checked is a receipt, not evidence.

```
pip install trace-verify

trace-verify \
  --claim your-record.json \
  --proof your-record.proof.json \
  --entry registry/2026/06/12.ndjson \
  --batch-id 2026-06-12-001
```

Exit code 0 means the record is proven included in that batch **and** its producer's signature verified. Exit code 1 means one of those failed, and there is no partial result between the two.

You do not need a clone of the registry for this. Swap `--entry` for `--entry-url` and both the entry and the producer key that signed the record are fetched over https, from an allowlisted host only:

```
trace-verify   --claim your-record.json   --proof your-record.proof.json   --entry-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentrust-io/trace-registry/main/registry/2026/06/12.ndjson
```

Needs `trace-verify` 0.4.1 or later. The command reports which producer key it used and where it came from, because a key fetched from a host is a different trust statement from one you already held.

The verifier is standard library only and small enough to read in one sitting. Read it, or reimplement it from [Anchor Format v1 §5.1](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/spec/registry-anchor-v1/index.md), which is written so you can. Verifying with a tool the registry operator wrote is better than nothing, and weaker than verifying with one you wrote.

______________________________________________________________________

## Step 5: Preserve the anchored record

Keep the signed object unchanged with its proof and registry entry. Adding `transparency` and re-signing creates a different object; the original proof no longer covers it. Submit that new object for anchoring if you change any signed field. A Level 2 workflow needs a registry arrangement that lets the final record name its entry before its bytes are committed.

______________________________________________________________________

## What this proves, and what it does not

Inclusion verifies the exact signed object against the supplied batch root. Authenticity and timing depend on the separately trusted registry entry or checkpoint.

Signature verification is a separate question from inclusion, and `trace-verify` answers both: it verifies the producer's Ed25519 signature against the registered key unless you pass `--no-verify-signature`, which warns loudly, because inclusion alone does not prove the named producer signed anything. Exit code 0 means both passed.

Neither says the record's contents are true. Inclusion alone does not establish complete logging, a trustworthy timestamp, or an append-only history either. For the last of those, ask the registry's own history the question directly:

```
trace-verify chain registry/2026/09/01.ndjson
```

That checks the checkpoint chain is internally consistent and that it still matches the entries stored under it. The second half is what catches an entry edited after it was anchored.
